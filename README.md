Gardening, as simple as it sounds, is a very intricate process. Few, but the steps to achieve a desirable yield must be achieved with great detail. Hence, “GARDEN HELP” was created. A user friendly, duty tested app, specialised to monitor the health of your plants. It provides the user with the details and condition of the plant. It even suggests necessary steps to be taken by the user for the betterment of the plant's health. The app works only with the sensors attached to the soil.
